    "This project is to demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. The plan is to use oython libraries to systematically explore a dataset, which in this case is the Prosper loan dataset, starting from plots of single variables and leading up to plots of multiple variables. In the exploration phase, I found out there were strong relationships between the borrower rate and borrower APR. I also found out a high percentage of borrowers were between the income ranges of 25,000 and 74,999 Dollars. The Prosper Score had a normal distribution and the debt to income ratio fell between the values of 0 and 0.5 apart from an outlier of value 10. \n",

    "I found out there was a strong relationship between the prosper rating and borrower rate and a higher percentage of borrowers with a high prosper rating had homes than those with lower ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also noticed there was a spike in the borrower rate around 2011 and that it has been in a free fall since then. "

    "For the Presentation I chose to focus mostly on the relationships  the borrower rate had between the income range and prosper rating. I chose to show the relationship between the borrowe rate and income range per year to see how it had changed over time and also chose to add the homeowner status into the mix to see if it created any significant changes. I made sure to keep my plots polished and in seaborns base color apart from the multivariate plots which needed color to be able to properly visualise the third variable."
